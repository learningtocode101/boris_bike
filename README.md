# boris_bikes

Maker's initial project to mimic London cycle sharing system.
The program will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make the bike sharing system.

## Built with
** TDD using Rspec and Ruby

## How to use
```
ruby bike.rb
ruby dockingStation.rb
```

## Authors
Collaborative, pair programming effort for a week amongst myself and the following individuals:
#### Hui-An Yang 
*Initial work involving user story, domain modeling and initial understanding of TDD*
#### James Hotblack 
*Completed feature and unit tests for making docking stations get and release bikes*
#### Tom Russell
*Added raising exceptions tests and limiting capacity features*
#### Connor Kam-Cheong
*Following TDD process to update code to allow docks to accept multiple bikes with capacity set my user*
